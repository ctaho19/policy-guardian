AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys with automatic key rotation enabled are rotated every year by default, approximately 365 days, aligning with a 12-month frequency, as affirmed by the documentation: "By default, when you enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key, AWS KMS generates new cryptographic material for the KMS key every year" ([Rotate AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html)) and "AWS KMS rotates the key material of the KMS key one year (approximately 365 days) from the enable date and every year thereafter" ([EnableKeyRotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_EnableKeyRotation.html)). However, this period is configurable from 90 days to 7 years (2,560 days) using the `RotationPeriodInDays` parameter, meaning the assumption of a minimum 12-month frequency holds only for the default setting and not when customized beyond 12 months, as noted in the AWS news blog: "You can now customize the frequency of rotation period between 90 days to 7 years" ([AWS KMS announces more flexible automatic key rotation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/aws-kms-automatic-key-rotation/)). Thus, the assumption is validated for the default configuration as of March 12, 2025.
