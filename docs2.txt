AWS Key Management Service (KMS) ensures that keys created in its standard key store, which can be understood as the "AWS_KMS location," are stored in approved hardware security modules (HSMs) validated under FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 by default, as confirmed by the AWS KMS overview documentation: "The AWS KMS keys that you create in AWS KMS are protected by FIPS 140-3 Security Level 3 validated hardware security modules (HSM)" ([Overview of AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html)). While AWS KMS offers custom key stores that allow keys to be managed by customer-owned key managers, potentially outside approved HSMs, this option is not enabled by default and requires explicit configuration, as noted: "By default, the cryptographic key material for the AWS KMS keys that you create in AWS KMS is generated in and protected by hardware security modules (HSMs)" ([Key stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-storeoverview.html)), with custom key stores detailed separately ([Custom key stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-storeoverview.html)). Thus, the assumption that AWS KMS keys are stored securely in approved HSMs by default, with the option for non-approved modules turned off unless explicitly activated, is validated by official AWS documentation as of March 12, 2025.
