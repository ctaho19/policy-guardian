Title: Analyzing Discrepancies in Counts of Machine IAM Roles Between OZONE and IAM Resources Datasets
Background:
I am working on a data analysis project involving two datasets to validate the count of Machine IAM Roles and ensure the accuracy of our Tier 1 compliance metric. Below are the details of the datasets and the objectives:
OZONE Data:
Purpose: Provides aggregated counts of cloud resources at the Business Application (BA) and Account level.
Key Fields:
ASV (Application Service Version): Equivalent to BA.
ACCOUNT_NUMBER: Cloud account number.
ROLE_TYPE: Type of role (MACHINE, HUMAN, etc.).
INVENTORY_COUNT: Total number of resources.
EVALUATIONS_COUNT: Number of resources evaluated for compliance.
Notes: Used in calculating the Tier 1 compliance metric.
IAM Resources:
Purpose: Contains detailed information about IAM resources.
Key Fields:
RESOURCE_ID: Unique identifier for each IAM resource.
AMAZON_RESOURCE_NAME (ARN): Amazon Resource Name of the IAM resource.
BA: Business Application.
ACCOUNT: Cloud account number.
TYPE: Type of IAM resource (role, user, etc.).
Notes: Used to get detailed counts of IAM roles.
Objective:
Goal: Compare counts of Machine IAM Roles between the OZONE and IAM Resources datasets at the BA and Account level.
Validate the total number of Machine IAM Roles (denominator of the Tier 1 metric).
Compare the number of evaluated Machine IAM Roles (numerator of the Tier 1 metric).
Identify discrepancies between the datasets to understand root causes.
Current Phase:
I have executed a SQL query that aggregates counts from both datasets and compares them. Here's what I've done:
Aggregated OZONE Data:
Grouped by BA and Account.
Calculated OZONE_TOTAL (sum of INVENTORY_COUNT for Machine roles).
Calculated OZONE_EVALUATED (sum of EVALUATIONS_COUNT for Machine roles).
Aggregated IAM Resources Data:
Grouped by BA and Account.
Counted distinct RESOURCE_IDs of type 'role' to get IAM_COUNT.
Comparison Output:
Merged both summaries to produce a table containing:
BA
ACCOUNT
OZONE_TOTAL
OZONE_EVALUATED
IAM_COUNT
COMPARISON_RESULT (indicates if OZONE_TOTAL is higher, IAM_COUNT is higher, or counts are equal)
COUNT_DIFFERENCE (absolute difference between OZONE_TOTAL and IAM_COUNT)
Issue:
There are significant discrepancies between OZONE_TOTAL and IAM_COUNT in many BA/Account combinations.
In the query output, COMPARISON_RESULT is rarely 'EQUAL', and sometimes either OZONE_TOTAL, OZONE_EVALUATED, or IAM_COUNT is NULL.
This suggests that some BA/Account combinations are present in one dataset but not the other.
It's unexpected that an ASV (BA)/Account would be present in OZONE but not in IAM Resources, or vice versa.
Goal:
Analyze the query output to identify patterns or reasons for discrepancies.
Investigate BA/Account combinations with the largest differences.
Determine if discrepancies are due to:
Missing data in one of the datasets.
Misclassification of role types.
Data ingestion or synchronization issues.
Identify next steps to reconcile these differences and validate our Tier 1 metric.
Next Steps:
Analyze the Query Output:
Examine the BA/Account combinations where COUNT_DIFFERENCE is significant.
Note any patterns or commonalities (e.g., certain BAs, accounts, regions).
Investigate Specific BA/Account Combinations:
For BA/Account combinations with large discrepancies, extract detailed role information from the IAM Resources dataset.
Use the following SQL query as a starting point:
;
Replace 'BA_VALUE' and 'ACCOUNT_NUMBER_VALUE' with the actual BA and Account Number.
Compare Detailed Role Data:
Determine which roles exist in IAM Resources but not in OZONE, and vice versa.
Check if roles have the correct ROLE_TYPE classification.
Identify any roles present in IAM Resources that are missing in the compliance evaluations.
Identify Root Causes:
Possible causes might include:
Roles not properly classified as 'MACHINE' in one dataset.
Time lags between data refresh cycles causing synchronization issues.
Data ingestion errors or omissions.
Recommend Actions:
Suggest steps to resolve discrepancies, such as:
Updating data ingestion processes.
Ensuring consistent classification rules across datasets.
Coordinating data refresh schedules.
Attached Files:
Query Output File: Contains the comparison of OZONE and IAM counts at the BA and Account level as described above.
