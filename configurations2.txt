Work Items & Deliverables
Monitoring Procedures for JIRA 1105727 (Assigned 1/24):
Despite two dedicated meetings (1/28 and 1/29) to review requirements and answer questions, the contractor failed to document key details during the initial walkthrough.
Procedures were largely drafted by senior team members (Chris/Kevin), with specific revisions clearly outlined. The contractor did not proactively seek clarification or engage in problem-solving, despite explicit instructions in JIRA comments to communicate questions.
JIRA Tickets 1077128 & 1076435:
No progress made on either ticket despite multiple hour-long meetings to review procedures.
Required extensive hand-holding for basic tasks (e.g., executing VLOOKUP functions, navigating JIRA comments, interpreting platform-specific feedback). Senior team members ultimately completed the work to meet deadlines.

Performance Observations
Attendance & Communication:
Repeated tardiness and absence without prior notice (e.g., 1/17 CMT S1 meeting, 1/29 late login).
Delayed responses on Slack and failure to notify the team of schedule changes, impacting collaboration.
Technical Competency:
Struggles with foundational tools critical to the role (JIRA, G-Suite, Slack).
Inability to independently troubleshoot basic technical issues, despite repeated training (e.g., accessing ControlsHub, reviewing email notifications).
Initiative & Problem-Solving:
Relies excessively on step-by-step guidance for repetitive tasks, even after detailed walkthroughs.
Fails to document or reference prior instructions, resulting in redundant questions and stalled progress.
Minimal evidence of independent research or effort to resolve blockers between check-ins.

Key Concerns
Communication Gaps:
Consistent failure to proactively flag challenges, delays, or knowledge gaps.
Over-reliance on team members to initiate progress updates, creating workflow inefficiencies.
Role-Specific Skills:
Inability to retain or apply training on core platforms/tools, raising concerns about scalability as role complexity increases.
Limited technical aptitude for data analysis (e.g., Excel functions) and task management (e.g., JIRA navigation).
Ownership & Accountability:
Repeatedly requires re-explanation of tasks, indicating a lack of engagement with provided resources.
Fails to follow through on action items without direct oversight, delaying project timelines.

Recommendation
Based on the contractor’s performance during the onboarding period, there are significant concerns regarding their suitability for this role. The role demands a high degree of autonomy, technical proficiency, and proactive communication—competencies that have not been demonstrated consistently.
Suggested Next Steps:
Formalize a 30-day performance improvement plan (PIP) with clear benchmarks for communication, task ownership, and tool proficiency.
If no measurable progress is observed within the PIP window, consider terminating the contract to minimize further project delays and team resource strain.
