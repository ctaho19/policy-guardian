For these low-coverage accounts, I'd like to know:
Region Distribution:
Are all the roles in the 'global' region, or are they spread across different regions?
If in multiple regions, is the coverage consistently low across all regions?
Role Type Patterns:
Are we seeing only 'MACHINE' roles, or are there other role types ('N/A', '', etc.) for these accounts?
If multiple role types exist, how does their coverage compare?
Data Consistency:
Are there any unusual patterns in how INVENTORY_COUNT relates to TOTAL_EVALUATIONS_COUNT?
Are there any NULL values or unexpected values in any fields?
