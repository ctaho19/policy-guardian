Based on this data , can you answer the following questions?


1. For the low-coverage accounts (the ones with 1.15%, 2.63%, and 2.94%):
What are their inventory_count values typically like?
What are their total_evaluations typically like?
Are they consistently low across all their ASVs?
For the high-ASV accounts:
Is there a pattern where certain ASVs consistently have better/worse coverage?
Do you see any patterns in the ASV names (if visible) that might indicate why some have better coverage than others?
Are there any ASVs with unusually high inventory_counts compared to others?
For both groups:
Are there any notable differences in how the inventory_count vs total_evaluations ratio looks between the two groups?
Do you see any patterns in the coverage percentages? (e.g., are they clustered around certain values, or spread evenly?)
