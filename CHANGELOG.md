## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

#### üöÄ Complete Architecture Overhaul
- **Modern Python packaging** with `pyproject.toml` and proper dependency management
- **Command-line interface (CLI)** with comprehensive options and beautiful output formatting
- **Extensible plugin system** for custom security checks
- **Type safety** with comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
- **Memory-efficient parsing** using `lxml.etree.iterparse()` for large configuration files
- **Security hardening** against XXE attacks and other XML vulnerabilities

#### üîç Enhanced Security Checks
- **Overly Permissive Rules Check**: Detects rules with broad permissions and calculates severity based on risk level
- **Redundant Rules Check**: Finds unnecessary duplicates and 'any' used alongside specific values
- **Zone-Based Check**: Comprehensive zone configuration validation
- **Shadowing Rules Check**: Advanced rule precedence analysis to detect overshadowed rules
- **Rules Missing Security Profiles Check**: Ensures allow rules have appropriate security measures

#### üñ•Ô∏è Modern GUI Interface
- **PyQt6-based GUI** with modern, responsive design
- **Background processing** with progress tracking and status updates
- **Tabbed results view** with summary and detailed analysis
- **Severity filtering** and color-coded results
- **Settings persistence** with QSettings
- **Drag-and-drop file support** (future enhancement)

#### üîß Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive test suite** with pytest and >90% coverage target
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with multi-platform testing (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automated code quality enforcement
- **Security auditing** with bandit and pip-audit
- **Documentation generation** with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs integration

#### üì¶ Distribution & Deployment
- **PyPI publishing** with automatic releases
- **Standalone executables** for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Docker support** (future enhancement)
- **Multiple installation methods**: pip, pipx, source, and pre-built binaries

#### üîå Extensibility
- **Plugin architecture** allows custom security checks
- **Check registry system** for automatic discovery and registration
- **Event hooks** for custom integrations
- **API access** for programmatic usage

### Changed

#### üìÅ Project Structure
- Migrated from flat structure to proper Python package layout (`src/policyguardian/`)
- Separated core business logic from UI components
- Introduced modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Standardized naming conventions and file organization

#### üîí Security Improvements
- **XML parsing security**: Disabled external entity processing to prevent XXE attacks
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation of configuration files and user inputs
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling with appropriate logging
- **Dependency management**: Pinned versions and security auditing

#### ‚ö° Performance Enhancements
- **Memory efficiency**: Iterative XML parsing for large files
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-threaded analysis capabilities
- **Caching**: Smart caching of parsed configurations
- **Optimized algorithms**: Improved check algorithms for better performance

### Fixed

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed XML parsing issues with malformed configurations
- Resolved memory leaks in large file processing
- Corrected rule matching logic in various security checks
- Fixed GUI responsiveness issues during analysis

#### üîß Technical Debt
- Replaced print statements with proper logging system
- Eliminated code duplication through shared base classes
- Improved error messages and user feedback
- Standardized configuration handling

### Deprecated

- **Legacy GUI.py**: Replaced with modern PyQt6-based interface
- **Old Test Scripts/**: Migrated to proper pytest-based test suite
- **requirements.txt**: Replaced with pyproject.toml dependency management

### Removed

- **Hardcoded file paths**: Replaced with configurable options
- **Unsafe XML parsing**: Removed vulnerable XML processing methods
- **Legacy Python 2 compatibility**: Now requires Python 3.8+

### Security

- **CVE Prevention**: Implemented secure XML parsing to prevent XXE attacks
- **Dependency Auditing**: Added automated security scanning of dependencies
- **Input Sanitization**: Enhanced validation of all user inputs
- **Secure Defaults**: All security-sensitive options default to safe values

## Release Notes

### Migration Guide from 0.x to 1.0

#### Installation Changes
```bash
# Old installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# New installation
pip install policy-guardian[gui]
```

#### Usage Changes
```bash
# Old GUI usage
python GUI.py

# New usage
policyguardian-gui  # or
policy-guardian analyze config.xml
```

#### API Changes
```python
# Old usage (if any)
from PolicyGuardian import analyze_config

# New usage
from policyguardian import PolicyAnalyzer
analyzer = PolicyAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_file("config.xml")
```

### Upgrade Path

1. **Backup existing configurations** and results
2. **Uninstall old version**: Remove old files and dependencies
3. **Install new version**: `pip install policy-guardian[gui]`
4. **Update scripts**: Modify any automation scripts to use new CLI
5. **Test functionality**: Verify analysis results with known configurations

### Breaking Changes

- **Python version requirement**: Now requires Python 3.8+
- **Package structure**: Import paths have changed
- **CLI interface**: Complete rewrite with new command structure
- **Configuration format**: New TOML-based configuration system

### Compatibility

- **Backward compatibility**: Configuration files remain compatible
- **Report format**: JSON output format has been enhanced but remains parseable
- **Check results**: All existing security checks produce equivalent or improved results
